To be handled:

10. The expression guarding if-statements and while-loops must be boolean.
11. The literals "false" and "true" are boolean constants.
3. The OP4 operators create boolean results.
6. The left-hand of assignment must be a variable, and the right-hand side must be an expression of the variable's type.
7. When used as a value, a variable's type is its declared type.

Errors handled
--------------

12. The literal numbers 0 through 2147483647 are integer constants. Numbers outside of that range should be flagged as illegal.
5. Each variables may only be declared once.
8. Only integer variables may be assigned the result of readInt.
4. All variables must be declared with a particular type.
9. writeInt's expression must evaluate to an integer.
1. The operands of all OP2, OP3, and OP4 operators must be integers
2. The OP2 and OP3 operators create an integer result.--
